            "Scaling means increasing your system’s ability to handle more users, traffic, and data without slowing down or crashing."

            👉  When your app grows (more users come), your single server can't handle it.
                         So you scale the system to keep it fast and reliable.

      🧩 2 Types :

         1️⃣ Vertical Scaling (Scale Up) ⚙️ :

           👉  " Increase the power of a single machine."

            Examples:
              Like upgrading from:
                 8GB → 32GB RAM
                 2 CPU cores → 16 CPU cores 
                 500GB disk → 2TB SSD
             💡 Think: upgrading your laptop instead of buying a new one.

            ✔️ Advantages :
                 Easy to do
                 No code changes required
                 Good for small apps

            ❌ Disadvantages
                 Limit to how much you can upgrade (you can’t buy an infinite CPU machine)
                 Single point of failure
                 High-performance hardware = costly

         2️⃣ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out) 🔗 :

           👉 " Add more machines instead of upgrading one machine."   
              
            Examples:
                 1 server → 5 servers
                 5 servers → 50 servers
                 Used by Google, Netflix, Amazon
              - Users are distributed across these machines.
             💡 Think: instead of upgrading to one big shop, you open many small shops.

            ✔️ Advantages :
                 Almost infinite scaling
                 High reliability (one server down = no issue) 
                 Cheaper at big scale

            ❌ Disadvantages
                 More complex
                 Needs load balancers
                 Distributed systems issues (sync, consistency)

         📝 Summary for Interviews :

            ⭐ Scaling is increasing a system’s capacity to handle more load.
            ⭐ Vertical scaling means upgrading the same machine.
            ⭐ Horizontal scaling means adding more machines.
            ⭐ Most modern companies use horizontal scaling because it provides better reliability and infinite growth.
