  🚀 What is System Design?   

    " Designing how a big software system works internally so it can handle millions of users smoothly."
  
            It means deciding:

              -> How data flows
              -> How fast the system should be
              -> How to handle more users
              -> How to store, fetch, and secure data
              -> How different parts talk to each other

📌 So System Design = these things:  

    1️⃣ Architecture
       - Monolith? Microservices? N-tier? Event-driven?

    2️⃣ Components
       - Load balancer
       - Database
       - Cache
       - Server
       - Queue
       - CDN
       - API Gateway

    3️⃣ Database Design
       - SQL or NoSQL?
       - Sharding?
       - Replication?

    4️⃣ Performance
       - Caching
       - Indexing
       - Compression
       - CDN

    5️⃣ Scalability
       - Vertical scaling (bigger server)
       - Horizontal scaling (more servers)

    6️⃣ Reliability
       - Backups
       - Failover
       - Redundancy

💡 Easiest Definition for Interviews 
   
       👉 “System Design is the process of planning the architecture and  components of a software system so it is scalable, reliable, and can handle large traffic efficiently.”
